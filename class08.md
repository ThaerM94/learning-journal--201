* Layouts are some of the most technical aspects of web design. In order to properly present a website, it needs to have a well-designed layout in place. While in traditional web design we used to rely on complex single-grids and then repurpose each grid to reflect our individual box elements, weâ€™re not living in times where tools like Flexbox are available so that we can create multi-layered design grids and style each one individually in whichever way we prefer. 
* It has been a long journey up to this point, and even though these new tools exist, some designers are still struggling to put the pieces together. This is mostly because CSS evolution is rather fast, and with the help of JS and HTML5, that process can become more like a spider web.
