## Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming

## Object literals :
 A JavaScript object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces. Object literals encapsulate data, enclosing it in a tidy package. This minimizes the use of global variables which can cause problems when combining code.

 Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array literals, functions, and nested object literals.

### Object literals are defined using the following syntax rules:
A colon separates property name[1] from value.
A comma separates each name-value pair from the next.
There should be no comma after the last name-value pair.

If any of the syntax rules are broken, such as a missing comma or colon or curly brace, a JavaScript error will be triggered. Browser error messages are helpful in pointing out the general location of object literal syntax errors, but they will not necessarily be completely accurate in pointing out the nature of the error.

### Object Literal Properties:
* Add .
* Modify .
* Access Object Literal Properties.

## The Document Object Model (DOM):
 is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.

### DOM interfaces
This guide is about the objects and the actual things you can use to manipulate the DOM hierarchy. There are many points where understanding how these work can be confusing. For example, the object representing the HTML form element gets its name property from the HTMLFormElement interface but its className property from the HTMLElement interface. In both cases, the property you want is simply in that form object.

But the relationship between objects and the interfaces that they implement in the DOM can be confusing, and so this section attempts to say a little something about the actual interfaces in the DOM specification and how they are made available.
