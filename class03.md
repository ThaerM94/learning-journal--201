## Lists :
`<ul>`: An unordered list. This will list items using plain bullets.
`<ol>`: An ordered list. This will use different schemes of numbers to list your items.
`<dl>`: A definition list. This arranges your items in the same way as they are arranged in a dictionary.

## Box model (Boxes) :
1. borders
2. margins
3. padding
4. Content

## Loops :
 **if...else statements** :
1. The keyword if followed by some parentheses. A condition to test, placed inside the parentheses (typically "is this value bigger than this other value?", or "does this value exist?".

2. The condition makes use of the comparison operators we discussed in the last module and returns true or false.

3. A set of curly braces, inside which we have some code — this can be any code we like, and it only runs if the condition returns true.

4. The keyword else.

5. Another set of curly braces, inside which we have some more code — this can be any code we like, and it only runs if the condition is not true — or in other words, the condition is false.

**else if**
Suppose there are variety of conditions that you want to check. You can use multiple if statements to do this task.
 All the if conditions will be checked one by one. But what if you want that if one condition satisfies then don't perform further conditional checks. At this point else if statement is what you need.

 ## switch statement
switch statements do the same task that else if statements do. But use switch statements when conditions are more. In that case, switch statements perform better than else if statements.
