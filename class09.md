### HTML - Forms :
* HTML Forms are required, when you want to collect some data from the site visitor. For example, during user registration you would like to collect information such as name, email address, credit card, etc.

* A form will take input from the site visitor and then will post it to a back-end application such as CGI, ASP Script or PHP script etc. The back-end application will perform required processing on the passed data based on defined business logic inside the application.

* There are various form elements available like text fields, textarea fields, drop-down menus, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.

* The HTML `<form>` tag is used to create an HTML form.

### HTML | Tables:
* A table is an arrangement of data in rows and columns, or possibly in a more complex structure. Tables are widely used in communication, research, and data analysis.

* Tables are useful for various tasks such as presenting text information and numerical data.
* Tables can be used to compare two or more items in tabular form layout.
* Tables are used to create databases.

#### Defining Tables in HTML
* An HTML table is defined with the “table” tag. Each table row is defined with the “tr” tag. A table header is defined with the “th” tag. By default, table headings are bold and centered. A table data/cell is defined with the “td” tag.

### Event reference :
* DOM Events are sent to notify code of interesting things that have taken place. Each event is represented by an object which is based on the `<Event>` interface, and may have additional custom fields and/or functions used to get additional information about what happened. Events can represent everything from basic user interactions to automated notifications of things happening in the rendering model.

* This article offers a list of events that can be sent; some are standard events defined in official specifications, while others are events used internally by specific browsers; for example, Mozilla-specific events are listed so that add-ons can use them to interact with the browser.
